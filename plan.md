# My Fraud Detection Project

## What I'll do better:
1. Combine multiple AI models instead of just one
2. Add explanations for WHY something is fraud
3. Make it work in real-time (not just on old data)
4. Handle the "too few fraud cases" problem better

## Tonight's progress:
- [ ] Set up folders
- [ ] Loaded and looked at data
- [ ] Understood current methods
- [ ] Wrote improvement plan

## Next steps (tomorrow):
1. Build the basic model
2. Test how well it works
3. Add the improvements

# Tomorrow's Simple Plan

## Morning (9:30-11:00): Build the Basic Model
- Take the existing code from Kaggle examples
- Make it work with data
- See how accurate it is

## Afternoon (1:00-3:00): Make It Better
- combining 3 different AI models:
- Random Forest (good at finding patterns)
- XGBoost (fast and accurate)
- Neural Network (finds complex patterns)
- Add explanations using SHAP (shows which transaction details made the AI suspicious)

## Evening (7:00-9:00): Real-Time Setup
- Create a simple web page where you can:
- Enter transaction details
- Get "fraud or not" answer instantly
- See why the AI made that decision

## What Success Looks Like 

Good Results:
Catches 80% of fake transactions
Only wrongly flags <5% of real transactions as fake
Explains its decisions in human terms
Works in less than 1 second

Great Results:
Catches 90% of fake transactions
Only wrongly flags <2% of real transactions
Shows exactly which details made it suspicious
Works instantly on new transactions
